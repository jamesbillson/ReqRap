## RELEASES

Project Status - if its 'finished' the draft release doesn't show.

Number displayed at the top of the add simple screen is incorrect, and probably un-necessary.

## PHOTOS AND PROJECT DELETE

change the photo filename to contain the project id.
When the project is deleted, delete the files that have that ID in their filename.


## ANALYST AND REVIEWER comments
Use a Meta approach - maybe with the content links below. the string could be release_type_objectid
then a link router can bust that apart and get the related object view.





FEATURES

### PROJECT
Need a flag for auto-re-numbering.  
If the project has been released, then the numbering should stop re-numbering.
But add an explicit setting.

### ACTOR
Delete an actor either from a use case, or from a project requires 
you to move their steps to another actor.
Need to create the form to re-assign them.

### TO DO

To do which causes a flag.
Maturity field, or this could be stored in the version? there is a status field there.
Create is immediately 'initial', then a little button in the header to make
 each UC move forward or backward

### LIBRARY ITEMS.
Tags on library items
Search
Classifications

### TRACEABILITY

Add some form of free form requirement - maybe with an excel upload.
Have to think about the ease of adding connection between any change and a requirement.

### PRINTING
Set up a configurable cover page.
Company logo


### Collaborators
have an approver switch and a circulation switch so they print out in a table on the document.
also an edit switch, we already have upload.

Roles

Analyst – can edit requirements
Tester – can run test cases.
Client/approver – can sign off.
Collaborator – Can view only.

If you are the analyst (or any analyst employee) you can invite the other types.


## VERSION CONTROL ###

Roll Back for all objects individually - but some confusion on steps.

If I have step-flow and flow is versioned, it doesn't really mean much as its only a container.


Project Roll Back - at the moment use releases instead.
Objects created after the roll back point (RBP) to be deleted.
Objects active version to be the version prior to the RBP.

Go through each object type by number.
Go through each Object.Number by version, DESC.
Prior to RBP delete any objects that are created.
From the RBP back, set the active version to the first version encountered.
