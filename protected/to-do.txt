Release numbering


FEATURES

### ACTOR
Actor should have a 'Test Case' pre-conditions (e.g. log in as user)


### USECASE
Put 'This use case describes the process of:' in the system, 
then we can take the same thing and say 'this test case verifies the process of:'

## Status
## COMMENTS / TO DO's.

### Copy: 

### Library items.
Copy to a specific project function so you can add snippets/patterns

### TRACEABILITY

Add some form of free form requirement - maybe with an excel upload.
Have to think about the ease of adding connection between any change and a requirement.

### PRINTING
Set up a configurable cover page.

Company logo


### Collaborators
have an approver switch and a circulation switch so they print out in a table on the document.




### TEST RUNS
create the first test run when the project gets switched to testing.

### NON FUNCTIONAL REQ's.

free form.

Rules - Text needs to accept some formatting - bullets, line breaks.
Rules - health check

Roll Back to a specific point.

Objects created after the roll back point (RBP) to be deleted.
Objects active version to be the version prior to the RBP.

Go through each object type by number.
Go through each Object.Number by version, DESC.
Prior to RBP delete any objects that are created.
From the RBP back, set the active version to the first version encountered.
