BUGS #############

ID's when connecting a company to a contact doesn't work...
check the create routine in company controller.

############# Missing link in subcontractor was c.user_id -> user.id link was missing so 
the company relationship was picking up c.company_id rather than u.company_id


The contact gets connected to other instances of that company which then breaks the rights to 
view stuff.


Need to send a link to un-subscribe.

BIDDERS:
BUG:  Bidders appear twice in the Subcontractors tab for a package until they've accepted.
Features: INVITING TENDERERS/BIDDERS
        Search based on trade.
        checkbox to select multiple invitees.
        Get to customise the invitation email.
        Response deadline.

NO BID MANAGEMENT INTERFACES !!! - submitted a bid for Station St 600 but can't see it.


SUBCONTRACT ITEM handling is rough  - types, multiple lines don't transfer to 
the subcontract details correctly, form doesn't hide/change with different types.


SUBCONTRACTS:
only one active subcontract per package - enforce it with model.

During manual create process, check if selected company has any contacts, 
get user to select an existing contact or create a new one.

Poke the selected/created contact into the followers for this package.


Do we need to manage variations to subcontracts ?  WHat processes are around this?

Changed type on Subcontract Item but change not reflected on form.



TENDER REQUIREMENTS
Need to add a rate type tender rqs
Added `unit` field to tenderqs but not reflected in code.

I have screwed up the types on Tender Qs and Subcontract Items - will need to fix forms and display.


CREATE COMPANY FORM
Company type needs to be more custom depending on the situation.

TRADES
Each company needs its own customisable trades list that's prepopulated with the standard ones.

CONTRACT
Maybe each contractitem has many packages rather than just one.

EXTENSION OF TIME

 - Rain days etc.
